# My-India-Redux
This repo is to create my india PWA app using Redux

#Install from source

First, clone the project:

Then install dependencies and check to see it works. It is recommended that you use Yarn for deterministic installs, but npm install will work just as well.

$ yarn install    # Install project dependencies
$ yarn start      # Compile and launch (same as `npm start`)
$ npm run deploy  # Runs linter, tests, and then, on success, compiles your application to disk.
